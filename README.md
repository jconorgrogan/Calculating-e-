# Calculating-e-
Unique way of calculating e, runs faster than Taylor series algo and is highly accurate with no rounding issues. Utilizes the function (1+x)^(1/x) as x approaches 0. Interestingly, Is perfectly accurate for each decimal place entered, eg x=0.000001 is precise to 5 digits for e, and 0.0000001 is precise for 6 digits of e, with no rounding issues
